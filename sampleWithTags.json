The subway map is the end result; it&#8217;s not a literal representation, but it&#8217;s much more readable than the actual routes. We also wanted to show the relative volumes, so the map segments are scaled by how many trips pass through them; you get a sense for just how much traffic the highways get, and how the routes branch out from there to cover the city. We only mapped San Francisco shuttles, many of these companies operate additional routes in East Bay, the Peninsula, and around San Jose, including direct routes from Caltrain stations to corporate campuses.<\/p>\n","thumbnail_image":4926,"thumbnail_gif":false,"primary_image":"http:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/SV-shuttles-e1593399343428.gif","body_image_1":724,"body_image_2":478,"link_to_live_project":"","link_to_blog_post":"","additional_images":false,"client_quote":"","name_of_client":"","related_projects":false,"add_to_work_page":true},"work_types":[{"term_id":27,"name":"Data Visualization","slug":"data-visualization","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"work-type","description":"data visualization description ","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":12,"name":"Maps","slug":"maps","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"work-type","description":"maps description","parent":0,"count":23,"filter":"raw"}],"industries":[{"term_id":18,"name":"Self Funded","slug":"self-funded","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":18,"taxonomy":"industry","description":"self funded description ","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw"}],"subject_matter":[{"term_id":23,"name":"Bay Area","slug":"bay-area","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":23,"taxonomy":"subject-matter","description":"Bay Area description ","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw"}],"technologies":false},{"ID":4922,"post_author":"2","post_date":"2020-06-29 02:40:14","post_date_gmt":"2020-06-29 02:40:14","post_content":"","post_title":"Cabspotting","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"cabspotting","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-14 18:17:14","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-14 18:17:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/?post_type=work&#038;p=4922","menu_order":0,"post_type":"work","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","acf":{"subtitle":"Cabspotting","summary":"Cabspotting","go-live_date":"06\/26\/2020","body_copy":"<p>Cabspotting<br \/>\nWe explored visualizations of GPS data from Yellow Cabs taxis in San Francisco.

These meetings were held in private and behind closed doors, which many feel ran counter to the open nature of the internet. In response to this, Google asked people to add their voice in favor of a free and open internet. Those voices were displayed, in as close to real time as we could manage, on an interactive map of the world, designed and built by Enso, Blue State Digital, and us!<br \/>\nAdding your voice was pretty straightforward: the map asked where you were, and if it could find your location, it dropped a circle for you right there.<br \/>\nOnce you&#8217;ve added your voice, you can share it\u2014on Facebook, Twitter &amp; Pinterest (which it looks like lots of people already are doing).<br \/>\nThe map was localized into 23(!) languages, reflecting the world-wide nature of the campaign.
