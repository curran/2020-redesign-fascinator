On top of this interface is a series of data stories that help bring this work to life, illuminating issues like food and housing insecurity across the state, neighborhood by neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>As the project was nearing completion, COVID-19 began its relentless march across the globe.

Audubon asked Stamen to use our data visualization expertise to illuminate this grim \u2014 but sometimes hopeful \u2014 story, creating visualizations of Audubon\u2019s latest projections of the impact of global warming on species across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wasn\u2019t Stamen\u2019s first collaboration with Audubon. We first worked together in 2014, when Audubon asked us to create a set of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/stamen.com\/work\/audubon-society-climate-maps\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">range maps by bird species<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its 2014 Birds &amp; Climate Change report. In 2018, we once again teamed up with Audubon to create data visualizations to show the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hi.stamen.com\/the-future-of-birds-in-our-national-parks-fa375a7f6f41\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">impact of climate change on bird populations in National Parks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which turned into a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hi.stamen.com\/bay-area-soon-a-conversation-about-the-future-of-birds-and-climate-at-ybca-d4bc80d59c3b\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mural at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this round of collaboration, Audubon\u2019s scientists made projections with much more bird data, and at a much higher resolution \u2014 over 140 million observations recorded, with resolution down to the 1km level, or 100 times the resolution of the previous data. They also expanded the number of species they studied.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We mapped the vulnerability of these bird populations in North America across three climate change scenarios: 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 degrees increase in temperature. With this larger data set we were able to show climate impacts at a much more granular level than ever before &#8211; enabling search by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.audubon.org\/climate\/survivalbydegrees\/county?zipCode=56904\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zip code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.audubon.org\/climate\/survivalbydegrees\/state\/us\/az\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">state<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.audubon.org\/climate\/survivalbydegrees\/flyway\/central\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flyway<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see the impacts of climate change scenarios on the local bird populations. The visualization uses color coding to clearly and immediately convey the dire consequences of climate change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also included in the visualization are climate-related threats such as fire weather, heavy rain, and urbanization, which are exacerbated by climate change and contribute to disruption of bird populations. All of these threats influence bird habitats in some way, though they were not used directly in crafting the range projections. These threats to bird habitats from climate change are complex and interconnected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this work tells a personal story: the story of how climate change impacts bird habitats at a very local level across the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","thumbnail_image":"https:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Audubon_thumbnail-e1593400399711.jpg","thumbnail_gif":3848,"primary_image":"https:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Audubon_hero.jpg","body_image_1":"https:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Screen-Shot-2020-04-13-at-3.07.34-PM.png","body_image_2":"https:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Screen-Shot-2020-04-13-at-3.08.21-PM.png","link_to_live_project":"https:\/\/www.audubon.org\/climate\/survivalbydegrees\/","link_to_blog_post":"https:\/\/hi.stamen.com\/exploring-the-impact-of-global-warming-on-north-american-birds-with-audubon-7a60f57ef681","additional_images":false,"client_quote":"","name_of_client":"Audubon Society ","related_projects":false,"add_to_work_page":true},"work_types":[{"term_id":27,"name":"Data Visualization","slug":"data-visualization","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":27,"taxonomy":"work-type","description":"data visualization description ","parent":0,"count":15,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":26,"name":"Interactive","slug":"interactive","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":26,"taxonomy":"work-type","description":"interactive description","parent":0,"count":23,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":12,"name":"Maps","slug":"maps","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy":"work-type","description":"maps description","parent":0,"count":23,"filter":"raw"}],"industries":[{"term_id":15,"name":"Nonprofit &amp; NGO","slug":"nonprofit-ngo","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":15,"taxonomy":"industry","description":"nonprofit &amp; ngo description","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"}],"subject_matter":[{"term_id":9,"name":"Environment","slug":"environment","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"subject-matter","description":"environment description","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw"}],"technologies":false},{"ID":4927,"post_author":"2","post_date":"2020-06-29 03:06:31","post_date_gmt":"2020-06-29 03:06:31","post_content":"","post_title":"A Day of Financial Transactions","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"a-day-of-financial-transactions","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-14 18:16:20","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-14 18:16:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/stamenstaging.wpengine.com\/?post_type=work&#038;p=4927","menu_order":0,"post_type":"work","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","acf":{"subtitle":"A Day of Financial Transactions","summary":"A Day of Financial Transactions","go-live_date":"06\/26\/2020","body_copy":"<p>A Day of Financial Transactions<br \/>\nThis is a visualization of a day&#8217;s worth of trading data on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
